and our service providers, for the following online payment service ("the Service" or "Service"). The Service is comprised of                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
, a service that allows you to pay only your                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
bill online (without the ability to view such bills online). You "signify" your acceptance of these Terms and Conditions by clicking the checkbox below the Terms and Conditions next to the phrase "I have read and accept the Terms and Conditions above" on the Add or Update Funding Account page and then clicking the "Submit" button. These Terms and Conditions are presented to you for acceptance prior to setting up a Funding Account (checking account or credit/debit card) you designate to pay your                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC

                      <p>
Regulation E of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act applies to the portion of the Service that allows you to pay your bills online. The Regulation provides for certain protections for you and requires us to furnish certain disclosures regarding your rights and liabilities relating to transfers of funds that can be initiated before the first electronic funds transfer is made involving your account. Those disclosures that must be furnished before you initiate any bill payments via the Services have been incorporated into these Terms and Conditions. These Terms and Conditions will remain available on the                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
website and remain available for access through that website. We encourage you to print and retain a copy of these Terms and Conditions for future reference. The                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
website will not be available to you, including the Terms and Conditions, once your account is paid based on our agreement. Regarding these and subsequent disclosures, (a) you confirm that your computer equipment is capable of printing web pages, such as payment confirmation pages and copies of terms and conditions, and (b) you accept that (1) by clicking the checkbox below the Terms and Conditions next to the phrase "I have read and accept the Terms and Conditions above" and then clicking the "Submit" button and by using the Services, you accept these Terms and Conditions and (2) that any subsequent notices or disclosures will be effective as of the date we send them to you and/or post them on the                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
website unless we indicate in our communication a later effective date.                      </p>

                      <p>Your acceptance of these Terms and Conditions indicates not only that you agree to the foregoing and following provisions, but also that we can change these terms at any time, by giving you advance notice of the change (unless we conclude that, for security purposes, the change must be made effective before you are notified). These changes may include (1) modifications to or elimination of any of the then current Terms and Conditions, and (2) adding new terms and conditions.</p>

                      <p><b>Changes to Member Information</b></p>

                      <p>If there is a change in the Funding Account(s) used to pay your
                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
account, you must promptly notify us of those changes prior to the date(s) scheduled for payment. See section below entitled "Confirming Payments, Stopping Payments". Otherwise, we will continue to use the old information in processing pending payment(s). Please edit your Funding Account information via the website on the "Add or Update Funding Accounts" page. We will not be responsible for problems that may arise if you change the Funding Account(s) used to pay your                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC

                        <b>Scheduling Payments</b></p>

                      <p><b>Dates</b></p>

                      <p>There are two important dates in the bill payment process.</p>

                      <p>
                        <b><i>The "Payment Due Date"</i> </b></p>
                      <p>
This is the last date on which you want                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
to receive your payment. This date must be one of our Business Days. In many instances, this is probably the payment due date noted on your billing statement. If the balance you owe                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
bears daily interest, however, you may want to select an earlier date.                      </p>

                      <p><b><i>The "Processing Date"</i> </b></p>

                      <p>This is the date on which you tell us that funds should be credited to your
                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
account and is also the date on which funds may be drawn or deducted from your Funding Account (funds may be drawn or deducted from your Funding Account either on the Processing Date or within the next two business days). <br> <br> All payments on your                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
account made within the                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
Service website must follow the following rule: all payments made on your                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
account either within the                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
Service website or through other payment methods to                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
may not exceed the then current account balance. If a payment scheduled on the                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
Service website will cause any of these rules to be broken,                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
in its discretion reserves the right to either modify or cancel the payment if you fail to follow the rules.                      </p>

                      <p><b>Selecting Dates</b></p>

                      <p><b><i>ACH Payments</i> </b></p>

                      <p>
You must select the Processing Date for each Scheduled Payment you wish to make. The website will permit you to enter a Processing Date that is a federal holiday. However, if you do enter a Processing Date that is a federal holiday, the Processing Date will be changed to the next business day, payment will be credited to your                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
account, and funds will be drawn or deducted from your Funding Account on or the business day after the new Processing Date. <br> <br> If your instructions are received by us no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time (11:00 a.m. Pacific Time) on any Business Day (the "Cutoff Time"), the earliest Processing Date that you will be able to select will be today's date. If we receive your instructions after the Cutoff Time, the earliest Processing Date that you will be able to select will be the next business day from today's date. IF YOU ARE SCHEDULING A PAYMENT, THE PAYMENT SHOULD BE ENTERED BY THE CUTOFF TIME AT LEAST ONE BUSINESS DAY PRIOR TO THE PAYMENT DUE DATE TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS ENOUGH TIME FOR THE PAYMENT TO BE POSTED TO YOUR ACCOUNT.                      </p>

                      <p><b>Confirming Payments, Stopping Payments</b></p>

                      <p>A payment will be considered submitted after the Cutoff time for that Processing Date ("Processed"). Through our website, we will notify you of Scheduled Payments and Submitted Payments as each occurs. You may cancel a Scheduled Payment at any time before the Cutoff Time on the scheduled Processing Date by accessing the "Account Summary" page.</p>

                      <p><b>Funding Account and Payment Vehicles</b></p>

                      <p>We are responsible for the timely and accurate processing of payments on your behalf  following your instructions. Your instructions are deemed to consist of explicit authorizations of individual payments that you enter or edit on the
                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
Service website. You are responsible for the accuracy of your instructions. We will not be liable for payments we make or fail to make as a result of our following erroneous instructions from you.                      </p>

                      <p>You may have more than one Funding Account on the
                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
Service. If you do not designate a default Funding Account, one you wish payments to be drawn from first,                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
reserves the right to designate a default Funding Account for you. All    Funding Accounts must be associated solely with a financial institution based within the United States of America or its territories.                      </p>

                      <p>It is your responsibility to have sufficient available funds in your Funding Account for payments you schedule and you agree to ensure this occurs. We will not be obligated to process any payment of any item unless and until there are sufficient available funds in your Funding Account (including any overdraft line of credit account or any other credit account supporting your Funding Account) to cover the payment on the Processing Date. Notwithstanding any instructions from you, we are under no obligation to process any payment on your behalf that: 1) exceeds the available funds in your Funding Account, as determined by your financial institution; 2) is not in accordance with the provisions of these Terms and Conditions; 3) we have reason to believe may not be authorized by you; or 4) would violate any law or regulation applicable to our Service or your financial institution. You acknowledge that the Service is only for the payment of certain
                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
bills from your designated Funding Account(s). <br> <br> We utilize the Automated Clearing House ("ACH") vehicle to make payments on your behalf from your Funding Account(s). When we use the ACH vehicle, we electronically draw the amount of the payment from the Funding Account on the Processing Date or the business day after the Processing Date using the ACH. The payment will be credited to your                      Collections Marketing Center, LLC
account as of the Processing Date.                      </p>

                      <p><b>Dishonor of a Payment</b></p>

                      <p>We have no obligation to extend credit to you. Accordingly, if for any reason, such as insufficient funds, incorrect Funding Account information, Funding Account closure or suspension, or similar circumstances, your financial institution does not honor our withdrawal instructions in connection with a payment, you agree that we can do any, or more than one of, the following, as applicable:</p>

                      <p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
We can repeat the payment process one or more times, until your bank funds our transfer request. However, we have no obligation to try debiting the Funding Account more than once.                        </li>

                        <li>
We can cancel the payment we have made on your                        Collections Marketing Center, LLC
account on your behalf and charge your Funding Account to obtain reimbursement for any fees we incur for your stopping payment to                        Collections Marketing Center, LLC.
                        </li>

                        <li>
We can deactivate your usage of the Service with us so that you may no longer make payments through the Service.                        </li>

                        <li>
We may use all legal remedies available to us to collect the amount due to us in connection with the payment.                        </li>
